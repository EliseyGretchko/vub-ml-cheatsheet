# vub-ml-cheatsheet  
This repo contains a cheatsheet for the open book exam of the Machine Learning course at the VUB.  
Special thanks to [Kwentin-dsn](https://github.com/Kwentin-dsn) and [aminezarouali](https://github.com/aminezarouali) for their initial setup and contribution. You can find their original work in the `original`-branch. The `main` branch contains my adjustements tailored towards my strategy.

Note that this is not a summary of the course (with some minor exceptions). Approach this cheatsheet as an extended index with some useful pointers towards topics in the book that may be useful to answer some of the questions, but are not obviuos to find based on the table of contents of the book or the subject index (at page 400). 

Using this cheatsheet assumes that you have a printed copy of the book, which can also be [downloaded for free](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/files/MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf). The paging is consistent between the online pdf version and the printed version of the book. Note that only page numbers are refered, as the specific sentences/paragraphs were highlighted in a first read through. 

Alternative versions may be found or submitted in the other branches. If you want to contribute your version to this repo:  
-  Clone this repo  
-  Make your own branch  
-  Make your own version within the branch  
-  Push your branch/changes to remote  

Only commit changes to main if you find any mistakes!
